    <p>Data Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so
    that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. The lessons below were designed for those
    interested in working with genomics data through the command line.</p>

Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use their own computers to insure the
proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow. <i>These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools</i>,
but working through this lesson requires working copies of the software described below. To most effectively
use these materials, please make sure to install everything <i>before</i> working through this lesson.

<h4>Shell</h4>

<p>If you are using a Mac, the shell is available through an application called Terminal. To access, go to:<br>
Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal<br>
You may want to drag the Terminal application to your Dock for easy access.</p>

<p>If you are using Windows, weâ€™re going to be using the command line application gitbash.<br>
Download and install <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">gitbash</a> and open up the program.</p>

<p>If you are using Linux, the shell is available by default when you connect to your Amazon Web Service (AWS) instance.</p>
